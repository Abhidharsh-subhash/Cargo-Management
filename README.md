# Cargo-Management
In my cargo management project, I developed two modules: cargo manager and admin. The cargo manager module enables managers to assign specific vehicles to carry out cargo transportation tasks. They can efficiently allocate vehicles based on factors such as cargo size, destination, and availability.

On the other hand, the admin module allows administrators to oversee the entire cargo management process. Administrators can view and track the assignments made by cargo managers, ensuring transparency and effective monitoring of the operations.

This project provides a streamlined system for managing cargo transportation, empowering managers to make informed decisions about vehicle assignments while offering administrators a comprehensive overview of the tasks carried out by the managers.
